        <p class="lead padding-right-30 hidden-xs">The Identifier Services Portal provides a single
            place for researchers to manage global unique identifiers and
            track distributed datasets throughout the project lifecycle.
            Data entry is simplified by a context sensitive interface that
            recalls relevant information related to existing project
            entities.  Managing post-publication events is made easier by
            automated integrity and identity verification that will track
            registered data over time.  The portal intends to save you time
            and effort while encouraging data reuse and replication; browse
            public projects, or log in with your iPlant account to get
            started.</p>
